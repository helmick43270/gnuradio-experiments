The dot-grc file is a flowgraph meant to be loaded by Gnu Radio Companion. This module receives audio from the default microphone and removes a sideband in the complex frequency domain. This is part of an attempt to fit a HackRF clone into a software-defined single sideband amateur radio satellite uplink system.  \
The Hilbert Transform (absolutely no idea how it works) seems to perform better with a Hann (cosine) window rather than with a default Hamming (triangle) window with respect to carrier suppression. The dot-py code can be run without Gnu Radio Companion, but I think Gnu Radio has to be installed. \
I ran this flowgraph on a HackRF clone with a 50-ohm dummy load on the antenna output, and had another computer running GQRX with a DVB-T dongle with an antenna about 2 feet away that could pick up my voice. \

On 11/29/2022, I used a flowgraph very similar to this with my HackRF and a QRP amp and was heard on the Tuesday night 2m vertical SSB net on 144.19MHz. I used a DVB-T dongle with Alexandru Csete's GQRX app on another laptop to listen.
