The dot-grc file is a flowgraph meant to be loaded by Gnu Radio Companion. This module receives audio from the default microphone and removes a sideband in the complex frequency domain (please excuse any misused technical terms the author has not yet fully comprehended.) This is part of an attempt to fit a HackRF clone into a software-defined single sideband amateur radio satellite uplink system. 
The Hilbert Transform (absolutely no idea how it works) seems to perform better with a Hann (cosine) window rather than with a default Hamming (triangle) window. The dot-py code can be run without Gnu Radio Companion, but I think Gnu Radio has to be installed.
I ran this flowgraph on a HackRF clone with a 50-ohm dummy load on the antenna output, and had another computer running gqrx with a DVB-T dongle with an antenna to pick up my voice. Now the challenge is how to run two or three watts out while not simultaneously frying the DVB-T dongle.
